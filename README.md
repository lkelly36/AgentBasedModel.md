# Agent Based Model
### A repository for the purpose of assessment for the module GEOM5995 - Programming for Social Scientists, taught at the University of 
Leeds.

This respository contains the following:
- agentbasedmodel folder:
  - agentbasedmodel.py - the final model for the assignment.
  - agentframework.py - the class framework used in the model.
- in.txt - the environment file.

The agents move around through a number of iterations whilst consuming food and sharing with their neighbours. An animation was ultimately 
created to represent these actions.
